        <p>We are an established company that prides itself on providing 5/6 and 7-a-side football at excellent venues
            with excellent referees and sublime, unrivaled personalized trophies.</p>
        <p>As we run on a low turnover, this means we keep the costs as low as possible for our teams while providing
            safe, fun, and competitive football leagues. Teams can compete for the league titles in their divisions
            while others try to escape relegation or play for local bragging rights!</p>
        <p>Our leagues are FA Affiliated and fully insured, while we use only FA Referees to ensure an optimum playing
            experience. We record as many goals, saves, and tekkers as possible and put them on our social media pages.
        </p>
        <p>We are always looking for new venues, so if you are interested in getting a team together in your area, give
            us a call or message.</p>
        <p>At present, we have the following leagues:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Debden Park over 29s – Mondays 7:30-9:30PM</li>
            <li>Loughton @ Roding Valley School – Mondays 7:30-10PM. Tuesdays and Thursdays 8-10PM</li>
            <li>Waltham Abbey @ Town Mead – Thursdays 8-10PM</li>
            <li>Wanstead @ Eton Manor RFU – Mondays 8-10PM</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Look out on our socials for new upcoming venues.</p>
        <p>Football Nations League is for you…. We work with you! Need a different kick-off time? We endeavor to make
            this happen wherever possible. Need a player? We try our best to find someone who can help you out for the
            week.</p>
        <p>So where else would you rather play?!</p>
        <p>So grab your family, friends, colleagues, next-door neighbor, or your mate's sister's cousin's friend and
            enter a team now. Alternatively, if you are a player looking for a team, give us a shout, and we will get
            you some game time or help find you a regular team.</p>
        <p>Play with freedom…. Play Football Nations League!</p>
