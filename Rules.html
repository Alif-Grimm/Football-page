        <h2>League Rules</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Matches are 6/7 a side. Roll-on, roll-off subs are permitted.</li>
            <li>Matches kick off at different times depending on the venue. For every 5 minutes a team is late, they
                lose game time and the opposing team gains a goal advantage.</li>
            <li>Each season, teams play each other twice. The bottom two teams in the Premiership get relegated, and the
                top two in the Championship get promoted. Champions win medals or trophies.</li>
            <li>Fees are charged for the season but can be paid weekly at £45 per match. No deposit is required but is
                subject to the league's discretion.</li>
            <li>The referee’s decision is final, and overhead height is allowed. Free kicks, throw-ins, and corners must
                adhere to specific rules, including opposition players standing four yards away.</li>
            <li>Deliberate fouls near the area result in a sin-bin penalty and specific free-kick setups.</li>
            <li>Shin pads are mandatory, and players without them may be barred from playing. Metal blades or studs are
                not allowed.</li>
            <li>Players cannot enter the goal areas to gain an advantage, and specific rules apply to goalkeeper
                distribution and ball play.</li>
            <li>Substitutions must be made without gaining a tactical advantage and are allowed only at set plays.</li>
            <li>Slide tackles are strictly prohibited for safety reasons.</li>
            <li>The site prohibits drugs, alcohol, or smoking. Violations may result in bans or penalties.</li>
            <li>Teams must complete the season or provide 4 weeks' notice to withdraw. Fees for forfeited matches must
                be covered.</li>
            <li>Ringers (substitute players from other teams) can only be used under specific conditions. Abuse of this
                rule may result in penalties or forfeits.</li>
            <li>Officials must be treated with respect. Any abuse will be reported to the FA and may result in bans.
            </li>
            <li>If a match is abandoned due to lack of players, the opposing team will be awarded a victory by one goal
                or greater goal difference, depending on the match score.</li>
        </ul>
